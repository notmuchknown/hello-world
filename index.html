    <p>Khus is a fragrance extracted from a grass native to Indian Sub-Continent, called Vetiver. 
      Although it originates in the Indian Sub-Continent, 
      vetiver is widely cultivated in tropical regions. 
      The major vetiver producers include Haiti, India, Indonesia, and RÃ©union; a tiny but beautiful French-Occupied island near Madagascar
    </p> 
    <p> Some of the reasons to cultivate vetiver are </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fodder for animals</li>
      <li>Prevent erosion</li>
      <li>Weed control</li> 
      <li>Oil fragrance</li>
      <li>Fiberous Handicrafts</li>
    </ul>
